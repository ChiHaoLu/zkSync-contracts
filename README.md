# zkSync Contracts

> 1. To successfullty development in the zkSync, I highly encourage everyone scan the `hardhat.config.ts` first, there are lots of comments in this config.
> 1. Lots of examples are modified or copied from the repo listed in references, very thanks to zkSync and other impressive developers.

## Set-up

```sh
$ yarn install --frozen-lockfile
$ cp .env.example .env
$ yarn build
```

## Test the Contracts

> We need to run the local testnet([matter-labs/local-setup](https://github.com/matter-labs/local-setup)) first.
>
> ```sh
> # In another folder
> $ git clone https://github.com/matter-labs/local-setup.git
> $ cd local-setup
> $ ./start.sh
> ```

Run test:

```sh
# In this repo root
$ yarn test
>
$ NODE_ENV=test hardhat test

## Scripts

In the zkSync-hardhat-plugin, we should run the scripts with the `$ yarn hardhat deploy-zksync`, it will run the specified script in the `deploy` folder:

```sh
$ yarn hardhat deploy-zksync --network <network_name> --script scripts/<script_name>.ts
```

`<network_name>` could be:

-   `zkSyncEraTestnet`: zkSync Era TestNet
-   `zkSyncLocal`: zkSync Local Devnet

In this repo, you can use the yarn command to run the scripts by choosing different netowrk:

```JSON
"scripts": {
    "execute:local": "hardhat deploy-zksync --network zkSyncLocal --script",
    "execute:eraGoerli": "hardhat deploy-zksync --network zkSyncEra --script"
}
```

### Bridge Goerli ETH to ZkSync Era Testnet

$ yarn execute:local deposit.ts
>
$ hardhat deploy-zksync --network zkSyncLocal --script deposit.ts
Running example deposit script for the Greeter contract

Depositing 0.001 ETH from L1 to L2...

### Upgradable

#### Transparent upgradable proxies

Transparent upgradable proxies provide a way to upgrade a smart contract without changing its address or requiring any change in the contract's interaction code. With transparent proxies, a contract's address is owned by a proxy contract, which forwards all calls to the actual contract implementation. When a new implementation is deployed, the proxy can be upgraded to point to the new implementation, allowing for seamless upgrades without requiring changes to the contract's interaction code.

```sh
$ yarn execute:local transparentUpgradableProxies.ts
>
$ hardhat deploy-zksync --network zkSyncLocal --script transparentUpgradableProxies.ts
Deploying Box...
Implementation contract was deployed to 0x26b368C3Ed16313eBd6660b72d8e4439a697Cb0B

Successfully upgraded Box to BoxV2
Box value is V2: 42

âœ¨  Done in 10.87s.
```

#### Beacon proxies

Beacon proxies are a more advanced form of proxy that use an intermediate contract (called the Beacon contract) to delegate calls to a specific implementation contract.

Beacon proxies enable a more advanced upgrade pattern, where multiple implementation contracts can be deployed and "hot-swapped" on the fly with no disruption to the contract's operation.

This allows for more advanced upgrade patterns, such as adding or removing functionality while minimizing downtime.

```sh
$ yarn execute:local beaconProxies.ts
>
$ hardhat deploy-zksync --network zkSyncLocal --script beaconProxies.ts
Deploying Box...
Beacon impl deployed at 0x26b368C3Ed16313eBd6660b72d8e4439a697Cb0B

    This is not natively used with the current kind of proxy ('beacon').
    Changes to the admin will have no effect on this new proxy.
